This is a repository where I will build a basic website that will show my favourite cars.

I will be using basic HTML and CSS and will try to get a smooth feel and nice user experience. Even though this will be a bit of a simple website, it's an important learning step as this is the first time I'm using git with the Linux terminal alone, using WSL.
