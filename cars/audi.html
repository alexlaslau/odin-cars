    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the car I would like to buy in the near future. It's fast and really cool, one of my friends has it. The amount of torque and pull it has, crazy. (Specifically, I'm talking about the 3.0 TDI engine.)</p>
    <h3>The specs of the car:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Most important : 3.0 TDI 230 HP engine</li>
        <li>Quattro</li>
        <li>Sedan, S Line</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For me, the most important thing is the driving experience. The level of comfort an A7 Audi has, it's incredible. It's such a beautiful driving experience in one of these beasts. Some dope things about this car:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It has a beautiful looking design and a bit of a fierce look, which I like.</li>
        <li>Packs a very strong punch, with 230 HP, you will literally feel like you are driving a space shuttle.</li>
        <li>The fuel consumption is also not as bad as you can imagine. I went the friend I have, which I had mentioned above, on a highway cruise a few days back and the fuel consumption was about 8-9 liters of diesel / 100km. Which is actually insane for highway driving conditions in my opinion.</li>
    </ul>
