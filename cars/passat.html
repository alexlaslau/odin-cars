        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This was my first car when I turned 18. It was old, like 16 years old at that point. But boy did I love it. I enjoyed cruising at night with it and I created some beautiful memories with it.</p>
        <h3>What were the specs of the car?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2.0 TDI Engine</li>
            <li>6 speed manual</li>
            <li>140 HP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It also had a lot of problems as you can imagine.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>It had difficulties starting.</li>
            <li>It was always smelling like diesel inside the car because of weird problems with the car.</li>
            <li>At the end of its life, it was "eating" a lot of oil.</li>
        </ol>
