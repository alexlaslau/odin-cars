        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the car I currently own. It economical and practical, but it's a bit boring. You'll see why when you'll see the specs below.</p>
        <h3>The specs of the car.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.0 aspirated gas engine (MPI)</li>
            <li>5 speed manual</li>
            <li>75 HP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even though I like the car and I enjoy driving it, the driving experience isn't as cool as it was with the Passat. The cool thing tho is that it's a bit newer, only 7 years old at the time of writing this. Some cool things I noticed about it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Driving gas cars is different than driving diesel cars. They seem to be a bit "cleaner" in the sense that the burning of the fuel seems to not be as dirty as the diesel burning.</li>
            <li>It's very economical, consuming between 4-6 liters for each 100km. Which is very nice.</li>
        </ol>
